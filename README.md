## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

As part of our plan of living in Hawaii we are looking to invest in a Surf & Shake shop, in order to get this off the ground we are on our way to convince W. Aby to invest on our project.

Extending on the main concern W. Aby we'll dive into the data to explain why this is bulletproof business plan.


## Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

* June temperatures can be considered as the hottest days in Hawaii, but we want to understand if this is consistent through the whole month or not. As per the statistics retrieved from 1,700 measurements we can conclude that it is almost the perfect month of the year for both, shakes and surfing.
* With a mean temp: 74 degrees
* & with a relatively low standard deviation of 3.25 we can ensure that this month will be full of people wanting to surf.

* December temperatures will be the reference for the lowest of the year and will represent an acid test to our business plan.

* However we found out that the temperatures are not as cold as we might think and also they are pretty stable too as in June. 
* Mean temperature around 71 degrees & a standard deviation of 3.74.

* This business model will rocket our investment because apparently nothing can be wrong from a wheaters' perspective. June and December have pretty similar conditions despite being the months where the highest variation will be expected.



## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

In order to complete the whole analysis we must take into account some other variables as precipitation and seasonalities. Also take a look to the source of data we are analyzing in order to understand if it can be biased, for example is it the same behavior in all the measurements stations?

It is really important that in order to take an investment decision we need to cover all the possible questions that may arise at the pitch moment. Data can be helpful but we shouln't consider Weather as the only and final variable. What about competitors, and quantity of turists when is not holidays. All this can help you get a better idea of the risks and opportunities.
